# Insight-DE-2018C-Project

### Project Idea

The goal of this project is to create a pipeline that can ingest batch and streaming data of various types (text, numerical, images, etc.) for use in a financial modeling application. Ideally the application will store batch data, performing compuations or preprocessing as needed for later algorithms, and then combine these results with streaming data to make real time investment decisions. The pipeline will need to be able to handle an arbitrary amount of batch data, stream data with a high throughput, and will need ot ensure low latency so that decisions can be made as quickly as possible when reacting to real time events.
